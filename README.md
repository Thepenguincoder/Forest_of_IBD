# Forest_of_IBD
This was created as an honours project for immunobiology.
The two processing Python files were used to create the final processed data in this repository, but are not needed to train the forest itself. The actual raw data used before processing is not present but can be downloaded from MGnify. The studies used in this project were MGYS00002301, MGYS00004728, MGYS00003733, and MGYS00003712 (I used the phylum taxonomy files for each study).
The Random_forest file can be used to train a random forest based on the processed data. It also contains the code for validating the model.
